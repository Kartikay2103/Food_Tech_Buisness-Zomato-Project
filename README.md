# Food_Tech_Buisness (Zomato)Project
The project was developed using a combination of Python and Power BI.

This project is based on a **Food Tech Business (Zomato)** dataset sourced from **Kaggle**. The objective is to clean and preprocess the data using **Python** and then create an insightful, interactive dashboard in **Power BI** to uncover meaningful trends and business insights.

* **Python**
  The following libraries were used for data cleaning and preprocessing:

  1. **Pandas** – Used for efficient data manipulation, cleaning, and preprocessing to prepare the dataset for visualization in Power BI.
  2. **NumPy** – Used for performing mathematical calculations and numerical operations on the dataset.

* **PowerBi**
  **Food Tech Buisness (Zomato)** Insights:
    1. Total Orders: 45k orders were recorded during the given period.
    2. Average Rating: Customers consistently rated 5.
    3. Avgrage Delivery Time: 26.37 minutes per order.
* **Order Patterns**:
    1. Types of Orders: Orders are almost equally distributed across Snacks, Meals, Drinks, and Buffets, each contributing ~11K orders.
    2. City-Wise Orders:
       Metropolitan Areas: 77.47% of total orders.
        1. Urban Areas: 22.17% of total orders.
        2. This shows that food delivery demand is highest in metro cities.
* **Imapact of Weather**:
 * Top Weather Conditions for Deliveries:
    1. Fog & Cloudy: 29 min per orders.
    2. Sunny Days: 22 min per orders.
* **Traffic Impact**:
    1. Jam: 31 mins (highest time taken)
    2. low Traffic: 21 min (fastest deliveries)
* **Festival & Traffic Anlysis**:
    1. During festivals, delivery times were higher (avg. 45.49 mins) and multiple deliveries increased, suggesting more orders and higher workload for delivery partners.
    2. Despite this, customer ratings remained consistent (5 stars), reflecting good service quality even in peak times.
